# 3DLayout Communication System

## Info Events sent by 3DLayout

The 3DLayout trigger different events to report actions when they are accomplished or to inform on GUI changes.

An example on how to listen this events

    var container = window.document.getElementById('ezzing3d');

    container.addEventListener("buildingSelected", function(event, data){
        console.log(event.detail);
    });

The full list of events emmited by the 3DLayout are:

<!-- * load -->
* zoomChanged
* fullscreen
* tabChanged
* editArea
* editKeepout
* editTree
* areaChanged
* buildingChanged
* roofChanged
* editRoof
* editVertices
* buildingRemoved
* buildingSelected
* buildingCreated
* customAlertOk

<!--  
### load

This event is triggered when the 3DLayout finish to load the project from the CRM
-->

### zoomChanged

This event is triggered when the zoom is changed in the canvas. It sends the zoom level value.

### fullscreen

This event is triggered when the user changes from normal view to fullscreen. It sends **true** when changing to fullscreen and **false** when disabling fullscreen mode

### tabChanged

This event is triggerd each time the user changes the aside panel navigation tab. It sends a string with the current tab name, the values can be one of this: [ "building", "areas", "keepouts", "trees" ]

### editArea

### areaChanged

This event is triggerd each time an area attribute is changed. The event sends back an array with this info:

    [area.id, attribute, value]

### buildingChanged

    [building.id, building attribute, value]

### roofChanged

This event is triggerd each time a roof attribute is changed. The event sends back an array with this info:

    [building.id, roof attribute, value]

### editRoof

This event is triggerd each time the user enters the  roof edit section of a building. The event sends the **building.id**

### editVertices

This event is triggerd each time the user enters the vertices edit section of a building. The event sends the **building.id**

### buildingRemoved

This event is triggerd each time a building is deleted. The event sends the **building.id** (after this operation this building no longer exist in the project)

### buildingSelected

This event is triggerd each time a new building becomes active. The event sends the **building.id**

### buildingCreated

This event is triggerd each time a new building is created. The event sends the **building.id**

<!-- ### customAlertOk

This event is triggered when the user confirm a custom alert dialog.

> You can read a description of this methods in the [Layout Rules](#layout-rules) section. -->
