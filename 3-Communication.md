# 3DLayout Communication System

## Info Events sent by 3DLayout

The 3DLayout triggers different events to report actions when they are accomplished or to inform on GUI changes.

Here is an example of how to listen to these events:

    var container = window.document.getElementById('ezzing3d');

    container.addEventListener('buildingSelected', function(event, data){
        console.log(event.detail);
    });

The full list of events emmited by the 3DLayout are:

Active changed: triggered every time the user activates this object or enters its edit section. The event sends the **object.id**.
* Building: activeBuilding, editBuilding
* Area: activeArea, editArea
* Subarea: activeSubarea, editSubarea, resetSubarea
* Tree: activeTree, editTree
* Keepout: activeKeepout, editKeepout


Finish creation: triggered every time a one of the following objects is created. The event sends the **object.id**.
* buildingCreated
* subareaCreated
* keepoutCreated

Edit points: triggered every time the user enters the vertices/roof edit section of a building. The event sends the **building.id**).
* editVertices
* editRoof
* editRoofFinished

Close panel:
* editSubareaFinished

Set attribute changed: triggered every time any of these objects attribute is changed. The event sends back an array with **[object.id, attribute, value]**.
* buildingChanged
* areaChanged
* subareaChanged
* treeChanged
* keepoutChanged
* roofChanged
* sceneChanged

Delete object: triggered every time any of these objects is deleted. The event sends the **object.id** (after this operation this object won't longer exist in the project).
* buildingRemoved
* areaRemoved
* subareaRemoved
* treeRemoved
* keepoutRemoved

Change tab: triggered every time the aside panel navigation tab changes. It sends a string with the current tab name ('building', 'areas', 'keepouts', 'trees', 'keepout-info' or 'tree-info').
* tabChangedApi

Save project:
* layoutProjectSaved

Clone:
* buildingCloned

Fullscreen enabled/disabled: triggered when the user changes from normal view to fullscreen. It sends **true** when changing to fullscreen and **false** when disabling it mode.
* ez3d-fullscreen-disabled
* ez3d-fullscreen-enabled

Lock interface:
* lockInterface

Invalid offset:
* invalidOffset

Undo/Redo panels: triggered when a customProperty has been changed sending the panel name.
* changePanelOnUndoRedo

Undo/Redo executed: triggered every time a undo or redo operation has been executed.
* executedUndoRedo

## Functions to retrieve info from 3DLayout
